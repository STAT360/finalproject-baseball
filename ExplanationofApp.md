# Baseball Shiny App

## Reason for App

This app was created for the UST baseball team to allow them to have a
better way to track hitting statistics. The user will update the app as
the game goes on. The inputted data saves remotely to a Google
Spreadsheet that can be printed from the site.

## First Steps

First, you must download all of the packages in the Package.r file.
Next, login to the Google Account and create an authorization key by
following the instructions in the AuthorizationInstructions.Rmd file.
From here, you are now able to run the app.

## Running the App

The user will input the date, team name, player number, type of pitch,
location of hit, type of hit, and result of hit. Hit submit. The data
submitted will save and display once clicking the “Data” tab. For
results on likelihood of where the hit will most likely be, click the
“Likelihood” tab. From here, the user can search or select a team or
player number, and a count will show where the ball is hit most often.
