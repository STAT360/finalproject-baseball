We are creating a Shiny app for the UST baseball team. The purpose of our app will be to create a heat map that the team can use to track hitting statistics. The app will also print updated reports. We assume we will get data from the baseball team, but the app will be continually updated by the coach. The purpose is to help the baseball team keep track of statistics for future use.
